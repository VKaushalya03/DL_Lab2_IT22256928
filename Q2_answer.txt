1. What happens when the number of hidden nodes increase?
As the number of hidden nodes increased, the model became more capable of learning complex patterns, so accuracy improved at first. However, after a certain point the accuracy stopped improving and even slightly dropped, showing that more nodes don’t always mean better performance.

2. Can you explain the pattern of the accuracy when the hidden nodes increase?
Accuracy rose quickly when going from very few nodes to around 3–5 nodes, since the model moved from underfitting to a good balance. Beyond this point, the accuracy leveled off and slightly decreased, which reflects overfitting or unnecessary complexity in the network.
